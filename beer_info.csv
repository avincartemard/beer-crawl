You can thank the hops for much of the flavour here and while intense, are quite smooth and easy going at the same time. For a rather high alcohol beer with big hop flavour the Bodhisattva is a delicious and gateway sour where even someone that isn t a big sour-nut can likely still appreciate the flavours of the brew.",http://beermebc.com/2016/03/28/parallel-49-brewing-co-bodhisattva-dry-hopped-sour-ale/

Together they brewed an Apple & Oat Table Saison that is packaged in a unique, 500ml, champagne corked bottle. Popping this bottle open (rather difficultly) it pours into the glass as a colour of straw with two and a half fingers of head that settles quick quickly leaving light lacing behind on the glass. An aroma of a traditional french Saison comes through on the nose with hints of fresh green apple. Despite the fact that this beer is a blend of apple juice and beer, the apple tones are subtle and meld well with the Saison tones. Tasting the Exil D Eden the apple flavour comes through in a much bigger way. The Saison still takes charge with a champagne-like, bubbly sensation on the tongue, light wheat tones, french yeast flavour and a big of extra body from the oat character. At the same time, the apple juice ads a slight tartness to the flavour and mellow sweetness at the same time. The resulting experience from this beer is surprisingly balanced and organic while being simultaneously unique and a little out of left field. If you want to judge it for yourself there is only one task at hand; Pick up a bottle before it is too late and let us know what you think.",http://beermebc.com/2016/03/27/four-winds-le-trou-du-diable-exil-deden-apple-oat-table-saison/

What was once the Star Struck Rye IPA is now the Scout and is named after the Baden Powell Trail that runs from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove. This Big, spicy and bold IPA pours from the bomber bottle as a lightly clouded, golden colour with a finger and a half of lacing head. The beer smells of citrus, pine and big hops. On the nose the rye content doesn t add the same spice that you may expect from other Rye IPAs. Tasting the beer it is a woodsy IPA with a strong pine flavour and a grapefruit-lemon citrus flavour that takes charge. The Rye flavour does come into the picture but the citrus notes mask its intensity. From memory, the recipe seems to have changed from the Star Struck making a beer that is more IPA and less Rye. It is big and flavourful but the citrus tones add a refreshing taste to the flavour. The Scout is a journey and wherever you are venturing on Vancouver s North Shore, this is  beer that will be a great companion for your trip.",http://beermebc.com/2016/03/26/deep-cove-brewers-scout-rye-ipa/

This time around it is an IPA called the Awesome Pacific IPA. Pouring from the bomber bottle this rather light, 5.9% alcohol beer is a golden colour and shows two fingers of head on top of the glass. From this head comes an aroma of piney northwest hops, citrus and a light malty-base. The smell is big with hops but also rather sessionable at the same time. Sipping the beer it has a big body for being a low ABV IPA and has a very nice hop profile. Piney bitterness and lemon-citrus notes take charge in a big and bold way. Despite the intensity of the hop flavours, the bitterness is not over the top. The flavour is balanced and bold with a true BC-hop flavour that hop heads will love. As a partnership with a media outlet that celebrates all the is great in Vancouver they hit the nail on the head.

The aromas are intensely fruity with notes of apricot, pineapple, passion fruit, sugar, and a delightful yeasty funk.  The taste proves a complex and delicious mix of sour pineapple, white grape must, yeast, crab-apple, and tropical fruit, with an acidic finish and subtle dryness that lingers long in the mouth.  These fruit flavours are complimented by a pleasant effervescence that makes the beer feel quite light on the tongue and compliments a wheaty mouthfeel.  This bottle of Cantus Fermus was aged for just over two months but further aging should mellow the flavours, making it even more delicious.",http://beermebc.com/2016/03/17/main-street-brewing-cantus-fermus-2015/

The Sovereign smells of a strong saison with strong belgian yeast tones, coriander, grapefruit and a touch of booze. The body resembles a high alcohol beer with wheat tones, yeast and a delicious belgian spice. Buildign through the profile is a citrus spice along with slight boozyness.

Through this lightly lacing head comes a big, northwest hop aroma with citrus and tropical fruit tones galore. The aroma will make any hop-head drool in anticipation. The body is more malt-forward than you may expect with a big malt along side the formidable hop. Together these two make a statement in a big but balanced flavour explosion. The malt tones balance out the bitterness of the hop and leave a bitter-citrus flavour to come through in the finish. BC loves hops but often forgets about the malty side of a big beer.

The flavour is light on the tongue and a hop bitterness comes in right away but so does the spicey, pumpkin flavours. Where typically there is a sweetness right off the bat a hop flavour cuts that early on leaving a delicate balance of hops, spice and autumnal pumpkin. This beer is a balance of caramelized pumpkin, autumnal spice and BC IPA hops   a great balance of seasonal and BC inspired flavours.",http://beermebc.com/2014/09/26/tree-brewing-co-jumpin-jack-india-pumpkin-ale/

The flavour is fairly light on the tongue for a porter starting off with light malted tones. This initial lightness builds into a chocolate flavour before the raspberry kicks in. As the finish approaches a chocolate raspberry desert flavour takes charge making for a delicious and enjoyable beer. The raspberry is not overly sweet and the chocolate adds a delicious aspect to this light and fairly easy drinking porter. As far as fruit beers go this is bang on.

Much like the flavour of lemongrass itself though the flavour of lemon comes through without the associated acidity that you may expect. The flavour is well balanced and with the combination of a smooth texture and a lingering lemon note the finish is lightly sweet with minimal hop bitterness but a citrus-lemon-peel flavour is left behind with its own bitter-sweet finish.

One of the first to come in this convenient sized package is the Saison. This particular saison pours into the glass with two fingers of thick and fluffy head which settles slowly leaving light lacing on the glass  sides. The aroma of the Four Winds Saison is warm with wheat notes, light clove and coriander along side a floral and lightly fruity tone. The smell forecasts a lightly sweetened, floral and flavourful beer. Tasting this saison the aroma was nice but did not do it justice. Starting off with a thicker than expected texture the wheat notes are paired with a traditional pilsen style malt for a balanced and well malted base. Through the flavour profile some light fruit tones become known along side a touch of clove. Closer to the finish a light hopped bitterness coincides with the wheat tones balancing the whole experience and leaving a fantastically balanced finish.

The aroma screams northwest hop with a very strong piney scent which almost seems like a spruce-style ale.  The piney hop has a sap like sweetness along side an intense hop bitterness that simply smells fresh and reminiscent about why BC Craft Beer drinkers love a solid IPA. The flavour starts off creamy and smooth being fairly mellow in intensity. This initial mellow builds into a well hopped piney centre but the hop does not kill the rest of the beer s flavour. Even to the finish the majority of flavour is the northwest style hop but it is not overpowering. The smooth, creamy texture along with a piney hop that is not overly bitter gives great balance while masking the high alcohol level simultaneously.

The finish of the tasting sees the orange tones mellow and make way for more cocoa. The cocoa is slightly sweet and leaves a nice, dry finish.

The beer is a slightly clouded, deep copper colour that pours with 2 thick fingers of lacing, slow to settle head. The beer smells as a quality Barley Wine should. There are notes of toffee, chocolate and of course a slight booziness with its 10.5% alcohol rating (2012 was 11%). There is a defined sweetness that parallels the hop bitterness making for a tantalizing aroma.

The finish is a strong hop bitterness with an alcohol tone along side. The toffee notes also linger until the final cord adding a touch of sweetness to the mix. The Woolly Bugger is a fantastic tasting Barley Wine and personally I believe that the 2013 is top of the heap and slightly better than the 2012 which was also very good!

From the N2 comes an aroma of chocolate, coffee and a creaminess that causes copious amounts of salivation. The taste is similar to that of the Ugly Sweater but is significantly smoother, creamier and seemingly lighter. These are all caused by the less sharp, nitrogen charged beer.

The aroma this beer possesses is typical for a Pilsner with crisp malts, light citrus notes and an overall refreshing appeal. The fresh-hop addition adds a further element to the smell though in a crisp, fresh, lightly piney aroma. The flavour is Pilsner up front and that focus remains through the tasting. As the flavour progresses a hopped bitterness grows in the back of the palate in a means that only a fresh-hop could. The faint taste of a fresh forest lingers behind the classic Pilsner base making for a complex, unique and delicious flavour.

The start is filled with a lighly toasted malt that builds into a sweetened oak, whiskey finish. The twisted oak has to be one of the best balanced barrel aged beers of this year. I would definitely recommend this to the beer-curious or the seasoned veteran, it has something that everyone can enjoy.",http://beermebc.com/2013/02/24/phillips-brewing-co-twisted-oak-stillage-barrel-aged-scotch-ale/

One beer that has become a bit of a legend is the Singularity Russian Imperial Stout. Being topped with a wax coating this beer is easily cellered but is also quite drinkable today. This black beer pours with two fingers of deep brown head lingering long after being poured. The aroma is sharp with an oak-bourbon smell coming on strong. The smell almost burns the nostrils showing off its impressive 11.8% ABV. The taste is bold. Starting off strong the bourbon flavour is big and ready to take your number. From here the stout kicks it up a notch and truly shows you its back-hand. The oak and bourbon flavours intensify further and give you that warm shiver as the creamy beer makes it down the esophagus. The overall impression is creamy and verging on smooth; but on the other hand it is an abusive partner that is leaves you battered on the floor.

When you pour the beer fro m it s beautifully labeled bomber bottle it appears as a deep, black colour and is topped with two fingers of dark and heavily lacing head. An aroma of rich chocolate and coffee comes through with a toasty malt base in a deep and delicious manner. The aroma is bigger than your typical Porter may exude. On the tongue this beer has a big body and a very creamy texture to it. The coffee and chocolate notes take charge and with that creaminess give an almost mocha like sensation. The Black Stone Porter used to be good and now it is great! It is on the heavy end of the spectrum but is also one of the top Porters available in BC!",http://beermebc.com/2012/10/02/driftwood-brewing-co-blackstone-porter/

A spicy malt first hits the tongue where the coriander is strong. This settles slightly to let the orange peel notes peek through before finishing again with coriander. The strongest part of this ale is definitely the smell while the taste is surprisingly more mellow than expected.

While this may be the first beer that the Bridge Brewing Co has released, they did their homework. This is a beer with great texture and taste that is sure to become a North Vancouver favourite.

This lightness settles into a lightly bitter citrus flavour that finishes with a taste of coriander and orange peel. The Wheatiness of this beer is apparent throughout but does not make for a heavy, thick beer as many wheat beers can be. Much of the IPA hop in this is masked by the tart, bitterness of the orange peel but it makes for a solid base for the other flavours to project.
